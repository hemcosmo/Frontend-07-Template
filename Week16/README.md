# how to componentize?

* container/presentation model
* composition vs inheritance (fp vs oop)

| container      | presentation     |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| smart          | dump             |
| A/B            | presentation     |
| api call       | ui centric       |
| data transform | user interaction |
